# Alert APP PEOPLE â†’ GARBAGE COLLECTOR

## Overview

This is a full-stack web application designed to facilitate garbage collection reporting and management for municipal services. The application enables citizens to report garbage issues in real-time while providing dedicated dashboards for garbage collectors and administrators to manage and resolve these alerts efficiently.

The platform supports three user roles: citizens who can submit alerts with photos and location data, collectors who can view and resolve assigned alerts, and administrators who have full oversight of the system including user management and analytics.
